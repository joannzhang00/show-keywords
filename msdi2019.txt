A Curriculum for a New Kind of IT Professional.
Changes in technology have expanded the reach of IT, while increasing the need for a new kind of IT professional.
The Master of Science in Digital Innovation (MSDI) at Bentley was designed to be suitable for a wide variety of professionals, from those with traditional tech backgrounds to those in other fields.The MSDI delivers the skills that encompass the entire scope of business and technology, from analytics and artificial intelligence to cybersecurity. It’s a modern, market-driven degree program for today’s rapidly changing high-tech world. Today, organizations are able to collect or access very large amounts of detailed data about their business processes, behavior and attitudes of their customers and actions of their competitors. This data can be used as a source of highly sophisticated information that guides business decisions. But, more and more, artificial intelligence–based technologies are being used to automate many of these decisions, and Internet of Things (IoT)–based systems allow an unprecedented level of accuracy in modeling how physical systems work and are integrated with the rest of the organization.
